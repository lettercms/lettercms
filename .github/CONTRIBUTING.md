# LetterCMS Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to LetterCMS.

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable, this includes bug reports, feature requests, ideas, pull requests, and examples of how you have used this software.

Please see the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/lettercms/lettercms/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow any templates configured in GitHub when reporting bugs, requesting enhancements, or contributing code.

Please raise any significant new functionality or breaking change an issue for discussion before raising a Pull Request for it.

Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- `main` and `production` are protected branches. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `main` or `production` branches.**

- `production` branch is latest stable deploymet.

- `main` branch is the staging branch. All changes introduced here, will be used to tests new changes in an production env with real users.

- Checkout a topic branch from `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- Don't use `/` i branch names, because CI system will create preview deployments with branch name. Example: `feat-split-testing`

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Add accompanying test case.
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

**Note:** Every pull request will create a preview deployment with the estructure `lettercms-<env name>-<branch name>.vercel.app`. For example, the `main` branch will be deployed on `lettercms-dashboard-main.vercel.app`, `lettercms-client-main.vercel.app` and `lettercms-api-main.vercel.app`

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 16+**, [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com).

First, you will need create:

- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account
- An [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) accout
- Optionally
  - An [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) account
  - A [Sendinblue](https://sendinblue.com/) account

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ yarn # install the dependencies of the project
```

Then run:

```bash
$ yarn setup # setup .env template
```

Check `.env.local` template and fill with your own credentials

Then run:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

This starts 4 development servers

- `3000` for Dashboard
- `3002` for Blog UI
- `3003` for serve CDN content
- `3009` for API

Blog UI receive a subdomain to render blog content. `http://subdomain.localhost:3002`.
Create an account on `http://localhost:3000/signin`, then add your subdomain on the `LETTERCMS_SUBDOMAIN` env var to render blog page on `http://localhost:3000/blog`
